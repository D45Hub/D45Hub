# Ahoy and welcome to this mysterious place. ðŸ‘‹

## I'm Denis - Nice to meet ya. 

As you might imagine I'm a huge nerd who is also currently a CS-student. Nothing really new on this platform I guess...
I just have way too many ideas floating around my head and this page is just a small collection of the ones I wanna share with you out there. 
They aren't the best ones, but it's the tiny tip of the iceberg.

And this might also be a good place to plug my website. Nothing much is happening here but I still wanna mention it. 

(Just click on the globe ðŸ˜‰)

As the saying goes. *It ain't much, but it's honest work.*
